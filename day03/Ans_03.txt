Difference between window, screen and document in javascript

***** ---- Window Object in javascript ---- ******

It represents the browser's window. All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
Global variables are properties of the window object. Global functions are methods of the window object.

The document property of the window object has the DOM document and associated nodes and methods that we can use to manipulate the DOM nodes 
and listen to events for each node.

***** ---- Screen Object in javascript ---- ******

The Screen interface represents a screen, usually the one on which the current window is being rendered, and is obtained using window.screen.

Note that browsers determine which screen to report as current by detecting which screen has the center of the browser window.

Example : 
Screen.availHeight

    Specifies the height of the screen, in pixels, minus permanent or semipermanent user interface features displayed by the operating system, such as the Taskbar on Windows.

Screen.height

    Returns the height of the screen in pixels.

***** ---- Document object in JavaScript ---- ******

When an HTML document is loaded into a browser window, then it becomes a document object. 
The document object stores the elements of an HTML document, such as HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags as objects.
The document object is the root node of the HTML document.
The document object is a property of the window object.
The document object is accessed with: window.document or just document

Example :
Document.children (Read only)

    Returns the child elements of the current document.

**********************************************----- Difference Between Window, Screen and Document -----************************************************************

>> Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. 
You can access it as window.

>> window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

>> window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.

Since window is the global object, you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window.
- it will be figured out by the runtime.

Difference between document and window:
                                                                document                                                                                                               window

It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.             --- It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   

It is loaded inside the window.                                                                                        ---It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.

It is the object of window property.                                                                                  ---It is the object of the browser.

All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.                       ---Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.

We can access the document from a window using the window. document                    ---We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window

The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)      ---The window is part of BOM, not DOM.

Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title ---Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.

syntax:     document.propertyname;                                                                                  ---Syntax : window.propertyname;
